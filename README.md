# ArtsPeepMigr
A program to migrate data from Arts People to other CRM services
## Overview
Any data migration involves a certain amount of guessing and approximating, largely because of the following:
* Data Quality issues can vary widely depending on who did the original data entry and whether or not they took it seriously.
* The structure of the data varies between the originating CRM and the target CRM.
* Particular data elements critical to the target CRM operation may not even be present in the source CRM.
In general, this program attempts to solve one particular kind of migration, that of sending data from the Arts People system to a different system, NeonCRM in this case. Since you have the source code, it can be adapted to other types if migrations as well.
